# HackerRankSolutions
These are solutions for contests, challenges and for algorithm questions located in hackerrank (Written in java). 

The purpose of putting in on a repo is mainly for fun, and so that I could keep track of when I was doing them :).

If you need to look up a solution, you may need to copy paste the code into http://codebeautify.org/javaviewer to make it more readable
as I submitted my solutions through command line.
